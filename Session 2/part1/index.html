        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>

        <p><i>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</i></p>
        <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called 
            <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food 
            (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the 
            target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, 
            <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as 
            <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

        <p>
            Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. 
            To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before
